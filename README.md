# edge-detection

## Overview

This repository mainly collects all the object detection solutions available in the market that can be used for 
implementing object detection at the edge.

## YoloV5

You only look once (YOLO) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. The solution is taken from 
the AI-On-Demand Platform [AIoD](https://www.ai4europe.eu/research/ai-catalog/yolo-v5-object-detection). The 
important characteristic of this solution is the dockerized gRPC-enabled service that implements the YoloV5 
model by Ultralytics. Thus, this can be reused for us to implement the YoloV5 model over the edge.
